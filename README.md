# Northwind Database Queries using MySQL

## Introduction
This project provides **SQL queries** for interacting with the Northwind database using MySQL. The queries include basic selections, filtering, and advanced database operations.

## Prerequisites
Before running the queries, ensure that:
- You have MySQL installed on your machine.
- The **Northwind database** is imported into MySQL.
- MySQL Workbench or another SQL client is available for execution.

## Activate the Northwind Schema
```sql
USE northwind;

Basic SELECT Queries
Retrieve all columns from the Customers table:
SELECT * FROM Customers;

Retrieve specific columns from the Customers table
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers;

Filtering Data
Retrieve all orders placed by a specific customer:
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 'ALFKI';

Retrieve all products within a specific price range:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE UnitPrice BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

Advanced Queries
Retrieve top 5 most expensive products:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM Products
ORDER BY UnitPrice DESC
LIMIT 5;

Retrieve total orders per customer:
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID;

Retrieve the total revenue generated by each product:
SELECT ProductID, SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Order_Details
GROUP BY ProductID;

Conclusion
These queries provide insights into customer orders, product sales, and general database operations within the Northwind schema. Feel free to extend and optimize the queries for advanced use cases.
