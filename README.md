# Northwind Database Queries using MySQL

## Introduction
This project provides **SQL queries** for interacting with the Northwind database using MySQL. It also includes an **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram** for understanding the database structure and relationships.

## Prerequisites
Before running the queries, ensure that:
- You have MySQL installed on your machine.
- The **Northwind database** is imported into MySQL.
- MySQL Workbench or another SQL client is available for execution.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram
Below is the **ER diagram** representing the Northwind database schema.

The diagram includes tables such as:
- **Suppliers**
- **Products**
- **Categories**
- **Employees**
- **Order_Details**
- **Orders**
- **Shippers**
- **Customers**

Each table lists its fields and **relationships** to other tables, demonstrating **foreign key dependencies** and how data is structured within the database.

## Activate the Northwind Schema
```sql

USE northwind;

Basic SELECT Queries
Retrieve all columns from the Customers table:
SELECT * FROM Customers;

Retrieve specific columns from the Customers table
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers;

Filtering Data
Retrieve all orders placed by a specific customer:
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 'ALFKI';

Retrieve all products within a specific price range:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE UnitPrice BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

Advanced Queries
Retrieve top 5 most expensive products:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM Products
ORDER BY UnitPrice DESC
LIMIT 5;

Retrieve total orders per customer:
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID;

Retrieve the total revenue generated by each product:
SELECT ProductID, SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Order_Details
GROUP BY ProductID;


Conclusion
These queries provide insights into customer orders, product sales, and general database operations within the Northwind schema. Feel free to extend and optimize the queries for advanced use cases.
